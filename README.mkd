#pyscheme

Using pyscheme is fairly simple.  It presently can access the Python C API and
also allows some higher-level functionality, but is still very primitive.
Here's an example of how to use it though:

    > (require pyscheme/py)
    > (init "libpython2.6")
    > (pyimport os)
    > os
    "<module 'os' from '/home/jason/.virtualenvs/main/lib/python2.6/os.pyc'>"
